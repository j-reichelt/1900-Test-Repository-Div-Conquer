Git is a powerful and flexible source control system, but it can be challenging as a beginner. All git actions are prefaced with the command git and enable one to interact with local and remote repositories. Important actions include:


git clone <url>
retrieve a full clone of a repository from a remote source
git status
report the status of the current repository
git add <files>
stage the specified file changess to be part of the next commit. If you want the entire directory, use .
git commit -m "<message>"
commit staged changes to the repository - don't forget to include a meaningful but brief commit message!
git checkout <files>
retrieve the latest checked in versions of files to the working
git pull
retrieve the latest checked-in changes from a remote repository
git push
upload the commits in the local repository to a remote repository
This set of commands should be good as a reminder, but for some interactive practice, try the Learn Git Branching tutorial.
